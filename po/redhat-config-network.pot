#. Use of this software is subject to the terms of the GNU General
#. Public License
#. This module manages standard configuration file handling
#. These classes are available:
#. Conf:
#. This is the base class.  This is good for working with just about
#. any line-oriented configuration file.
#. Currently does not deal with newline escaping; may never...
#. ConfShellVar(Conf):
#. This is a derived class which implements a dictionary for standard
#. VARIABLE=value
#. shell variable setting.
#. Limitations:
#. o one variable per line
#. o assumes everything on the line after the '=' is the value
#. ConfShellVarClone(ConfShellVar):
#. Takes a ConfShellVar instance and records in another ConfShellVar
#. "difference file" only those settings which conflict with the
#. original instance.  The delete operator does delete the variable
#. text in the cloned instance file, but that will not really delete
#. the shell variable that occurs, because it does not put an "unset"
#. command in the file.
#. ConfESNetwork(ConfShellVar):
#. This is a derived class specifically intended for /etc/sysconfig/network
#. It is another dictionary, but magically fixes /etc/HOSTNAME when the
#. hostname is changed.
#. ConfEHosts(Conf):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/hosts
#. Dictionary keys are numeric IP addresses in string form, values are
#. 2-item lists, the first item of which is the canonical hostname,
#. and the second of which is a list of nicknames.
#. ConfEResolv(Conf):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/resolv.conf
#. This ugly file has two different kinds of entries.  All but one
#. take the form "key list of arguments", but one entry (nameserver)
#. instead takes multiple lines of "key argument" pairs.
#. In this dictionary, all keys have the same name as the keys in
#. the file, EXCEPT that the multiple nameserver entries are all
#. stored under 'nameservers'.  Each value (even singleton values)
#. is a list.
#. ConfESStaticRoutes(Conf):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/sysconfig/static-routes
#. This file has a syntax similar to that of /etc/gateways;
#. the interface name is added and active/passive is deleted:
#. <interface> net <netaddr> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway>
#. The key is the interface, the value is a list of
#. [<netaddr>, <netmask>, <gateway>] lists
#. ConfChat(Conf):
#. Not a dictionary!
#. This reads chat files, and writes a subset of chat files that
#. has all items enclosed in '' and has one expect/send pair on
#. each line.
#. Uses a list of two-element tuples.
#. ConfChatFile(ConfChat):
#. This class is a ConfChat which it interprets as a netcfg-written
#. chat file with a certain amount of structure.  It interprets it
#. relative to information in an "ifcfg-" file (devconf) and has a
#. set of abortstrings that can be turned on and off.
#. It exports the following data items:
#. abortstrings   list of standard strings on which to abort
#. abortlist      list of alternative strings on which to abort
#. defabort       boolean: use the default abort strings or not
#. dialcmd        string containing dial command (ATDT, for instance)
#. phonenum       string containing phone number
#. chatlist       list containing chat script after CONNECT
#. chatfile       ConfChat instance
#. ConfChatFileClone(ConfChatFile):
#. Creates a chatfile, then removes it if it is identical to the chat
#. file it clones.
#. ConfDIP:
#. This reads chat files, and writes a dip file based on that chat script.
#. Takes three arguments:
#. o The chatfile
#. o The name of the dipfile
#. o The ConfSHellVar instance from which to take variables in the dipfile
#. ConfModules(Conf)
#. This reads /etc/modules.conf into a dictionary keyed on device type,
#. holding dictionaries: cm['eth0']['alias'] --> 'smc-ultra'
#. cm['eth0']['options'] --> {'io':'0x300', 'irq':'10'}
#. cm['eth0']['post-install'] --> ['/bin/foo','arg1','arg2']
#. path[*] entries are ignored (but not removed)
#. New entries are added at the end to make sure that they
#. come after any path[*] entries.
#. Comments are delimited by initial '#'
#. ConfModInfo(Conf)
#. This READ-ONLY class reads /boot/module-info.
#. The first line of /boot/module-info is "Version = <version>";
#. this class reads versions 0 and 1 module-info files.
#. ConfPw(Conf)
#. This class implements a dictionary based on a :-separated file.
#. It takes as arguments the filename and the field number to key on;
#. The data provided is a list including all fields including the key.
#. Has its own write method to keep files sane.
#. ConfPasswd(ConfPw)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/passwd file.
#. ConfShadow(ConfPw)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/shadow file.
#. ConfGroup(ConfPw)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/group file.
#. May be replaced by a pwdb-based module, we hope.
#. ConfUnix()
#. This class presents a data-oriented class which uses the ConfPasswd
#. and ConfShadow classes (if /etc/shadow exists) to hold data.
#. Designed to be replaced by a pwdb module eventually, we hope.
#. ConfPAP(Conf):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
#. The key is the remotename, the value is a list of
#. [<user>, <secret>] lists
#. ConfCHAP(ConfPAP):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
#. The key is the remotename, the value is a list of
#. [<local>, <secret>] lists
#. ConfSecrets:
#. Has-a ConfPAP and ConfCHAP
#. Yet another dictionary, which reads from pap-secrets and
#. chap-secrets, and writes to both when an entry is set.
#. When conflicts occur while reading, the pap version is
#. used in preference to the chap version (this is arbitrary).
#. ConfSysctl:
#. Guess what?  A dictionary, this time with key/value pairs for sysctl vars.
#. Duplicate keys get appended to existing values, and broken out again when
#. the file is written (does that even work?)
#. This library exports several Errors, including
#. FileMissing
#. Conf raises this error if create_if_missing == 0 and the file does not
#. exist
#. IndexError
#. ConfShVar raises this error if unbalanced quotes are found
#. BadFile
#. Raised to indicate improperly formatted files
#. WrongMethod
#. Raised to indicate that the wrong method is being called.  May indicate
#. that a dictionary class should be written to through methods rather
#. than assignment.
#. VersionMismatch
#. An unsupported file version was found.
#. SystemFull
#. No more UIDs or GIDs are available
#. Implementation:
#. A configuration file is a list of lines.
#. a line is a string.
#. self.line is a "point" -- 0 is before the first line;
#. 1 is between the first and second lines, etc.
#. The "current" line is the line after the point.
#. returns false if no more lines matching pattern
#. if while loop terminated, pattern not found.
#. optional whitespace followed by non-comment character
#. defines a codeline.  blank lines, lines with only whitespace,
#. and comment lines do not count.
#. returns list of fields split by self.separators
#. print "re.split(%s, %s) = " % (self.lines[self.line], seps) + str(re.split(seps, self.lines[self.line]))
#. replaces current line with line built from list
#. appends if off the end of the array
#. strip newlines
#. rcs checkout/checkin errors are thrown away, because they
#. aren't this tool's fault, and there's nothing much it could
#. do about them.  For example, if the file is already locked
#. by someone else, too bad!  This code is for keeping a trail,
#. not for managing contention.  Too many deadlocks that way...
#. add newlines
#. initialize dictionary of variable/name pairs
#. fields 1..n are false separations on "=" character in string,
#. so we need to join them back together.
#. found quote; strip from beginning and end
#. ignore whitespace, etc.
#. set *every* instance of varname to value to avoid surprises
#. delete *every* instance...
#. ConfShellVarClone(ConfShellVar):
#. Takes a ConfShellVar instance and records in another ConfShellVar
#. "difference file" only those settings which conflict with the
#. original instance.  The delete operator does delete the variable
#. text in the cloned instance file, but that will not really delete
#. the shell variable that occurs, because it does not put an "unset"
#. command in the file.
#. differs from self.ci; save a local copy.
#. self.ci already has the variable with the same value,
#. don't duplicate it
#. inherit delitem because we don't want to pass it through to self.ci
#. FIXME: should we implement keys()?
#. explicitly for /etc/sysconfig/network: HOSTNAME is magical value
#. that writes /etc/HOSTNAME as well
#. There doesn't appear to be a need to return keys in order
#. here because we normally always have the same entries in this
#. file, and order isn't particularly important.
#. for /etc/hosts
#. implements a dictionary keyed by IP address, with values
#. consisting of a list: [ hostname, [list, of, nicknames] ]
#. initialize dictionary of variable/name pairs
#. has nicknames
#. set first (should be only) instance to values in list value
#. delete *every* instance...
#. It is rather important to return the keys in order here,
#. in order to maintain a consistent presentation in apps.
#. initialize dictionary of variable/name pairs
#. /etc/resolv.conf
#. set first (should be only) instance to values in list value
#. if there is a nameserver line, save the place,
#. remove all nameserver lines, then put in new ones in order
#. no nameservers entries so far
#. not a nameserver, so all items on one line...
#. no matter what, update our idea of the variable...
#. delete *every* instance...
#. Need to make sure __setitem__ is called for each item to
#. maintain consistancy, in case some did something like
#. resolv['nameservers'].append('123.123.123.123')
#. or
#. resolv['search'].append('another.domain')
#. no need to return list in order here, I think.
#. ConfESStaticRoutes(Conf):
#. Yet another dictionary, this one for /etc/sysconfig/static-routes
#. This file has a syntax similar to that of /etc/gateways;
#. the interface name is added and active/passive is deleted:
#. <interface> net <netaddr> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway>
#. The key is the interface, the value is a list of
#. [<netaddr>, <netmask>, <gateway>] lists
#. since we re-write the file completely on close, we don't
#. need to alter it piecemeal here.
#. deletes a route from a device if the route exists,
#. and if it is the only route for the device, removes
#. the device from the dictionary
#. Note: This could normally be optimized considerably,
#. except that our input may have come from the file,
#. which others may have hand-edited, and this makes it
#. possible for us to deal with hand-inserted multiple
#. identical routes in a reasonably correct way.
#. need first comparison because list shrinks
#. adds a route to a device, deleteing it first to avoid dups
#. forget current version of file
#. no need to return list in order here, I think.
#. ConfChat(Conf):
#. Not a dictionary!
#. This reads chat files, and writes a subset of chat files that
#. has all items enclosed in '' and has one expect/send pair on
#. each line.
#. Uses a list of two-element tuples.
#. here i points to a new entry
#. eat up the ending '
#. eat whitespace between strings
#. now form self.list from chatlist
#. create self.lines for Conf.write...
#. ConfChatFile(ConfChat):
#. This class is a ConfChat which it interprets as a netcfg-written
#. chat file with a certain amount of structure.  It interprets it
#. relative to information in an "ifcfg-" file (devconf) and has a
#. set of abortstrings that can be turned on and off.
#. It exports the following data items:
#. abortstrings   list of standard strings on which to abort
#. abortlist      list of alternative strings on which to abort
#. defabort       boolean: use the default abort strings or not
#. dialcmd        string containing dial command (ATDT, for instance)
#. phonenum       string containing phone number
#. chatlist       list containing chat script after CONNECT
#. chatfile       ConfChat instance
#. ignore INITSTRING
#. elif not self.dialcmd and tempmatch:
#. First instance of something that looks like a dial
#. command and a phone number we take as such.
#. ignore dial command
#. ConfChatFileClone(ConfChatFile):
#. Creates a chatfile, then removes it if it is identical to the chat
#. file it clones.
#. some element differs, so they are different
#. the loop completed, so they are the same
#. lists are different lengths, so they are different
#. ConfDIP:
#. This reads chat files, and writes a dip file based on that chat script.
#. Takes three arguments:
#. o The chatfile
#. o The name of the dipfile
#. o The ConfSHellVar instance from which to take variables in the dipfile
#. print "[%s] = %s" % (str(key), str(item))
#. ConfModules(Conf)
#. This reads /etc/modules.conf into a dictionary keyed on device type,
#. holding dictionaries: cm['eth0']['alias'] --> 'smc-ultra'
#. cm['eth0']['options'] --> {'io':'0x300', 'irq':'10'}
#. cm['eth0']['post-install'] --> ['/bin/foo','arg1','arg2']
#. path[*] entries are ignored (but not removed)
#. New entries are added at the end to make sure that they
#. come after any path[*] entries.
#. Comments are delimited by initial '#'
#. assume no -k field
#. remember that it was there...
#. ...and get it out of the way
#. set *every* instance (should only be one, but...) to avoid surprises
#. some idiot apparantly put an unrecognized key in
#. the dictionary; ignore it...
#. there's something to write...
#. delete any instances of this if they exist.
#. delete *every* instance...
#. need to make sure everything is set, because program above may
#. well have done cm['eth0']['post-install'] = ['/bin/foo', '-f', '/tmp/bar']
#. which is completely reasonable, but won't invoke __setitem__
#. ConfModInfo(Conf)
#. This READ-ONLY class reads /boot/module-info.
#. The first line of /boot/module-info is "Version <version>";
#. this class reads versions 0 and 1 module-info files.
#. Version 0 file format
#. first "field" is null (before separators)
#. get argument name (first "field" is null again)
#. point at first character of argument description
#. deal with escaped quotes (\")
#. advance to beginning of next string, if any
#. end of the line
#. Version 1 file format
#. Version 1 format uses ' ' and ':' characters as field separators
#. but only uses ' ' in one place, where we explicitly look for it.
#. pull out module and linetype from the first field...
#. error: unknown flag...
#. ConfPw(Conf)
#. This class implements a dictionary based on a :-separated file.
#. It takes as arguments the filename and the field number to key on;
#. The data provided is a list including all fields including the key.
#. Has its own write method to keep files sane.
#. need to be able to return the keys in order to keep
#. things consistent...
#. change the mode of the new file to that of the old one
#. add newlines while writing
#. ConfPwO
#. This class presents a data-oriented meta-class for making
#. changes to ConfPw-managed files.  Applications should not
#. instantiate this class directly.
#. items are objects which the higher-level code can't touch
#. __delitem__ is inherited from ConfPw
#. Do *not* use setitem for this; adding an entry should be
#. a much different action than accessing an entry or changing
#. fields in an entry.
#. first, we try not to re-use id's that have already been assigned.
#. ignore nobody on some systems
#. if that didn't work, we go back and find any free id over 500
#. ConfPasswd(ConfPwO)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/passwd file.
#. first, we need a helper class...
#. make sure that we have enough gecos fields
#. make sure that we have enough gecos fields
#. username is not an lvalue...
#. ConfShadow(ConfPwO)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/shadow file.
#. first, we need a helper class...
#. username is not an lvalue...
#. we need that final '' so that the final : (delimited the
#. "reserved field" is preserved by ConfPwO.addentry())
#. ConfGroup(ConfPwO)
#. This class presents a data-oriented class for making changes
#. to the /etc/group file.
#. May be replaced by a pwdb-based module, we hope.
#. first, we need a helper class...
#. username is not an lvalue...
#. ConfUnix()
#. This class presents a data-oriented class which uses the ConfPasswd
#. and ConfShadow classes (if /etc/shadow exists) to hold data.
#. Designed to be replaced by a pwdb module eventually, we hope.
#. first, we need a helper class...
#. username is not an lvalue...
#. fields 1..n are false matches on "=" character in string,
#. which is messed up, but try to deal with it
#. snip off leading and trailing spaces, which are legal (it's
#. how sysctl(1) prints them) but can be confusing, and tend to
#. screw up Python's dictionaries
#. set it in the line list
#. snip off leading and trailing spaces, which are legal (it's
#. how sysctl(1) prints them) but can be confusing, and tend to
#. screw up Python's dictionaries

#. This module manages SMB configuration file handling
#. These classes are available:
#. ConfSMB(Conf):
#. Implements a dictionary of dictionaries of bools, ints, and strings.
#. Toplevel key is a string representing a share
#. Second level keys are literals representing config options.
#. Booleans are set and stored as 0/1, but read in the file as any legal
#. value, including (case insensitive) 0/false/no and 1/true/yes
#. So: turn off browsing home directories with
#. smb['homes'] = [ 'browseable', 0 ]
