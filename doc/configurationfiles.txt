Work In Progress - please add the files you're working on here

************************************************************************
This is meant to be a short description of what files are used by the
network configuration the information they contain they contain.

PROFILES.

The network configuration system is profiled - this means that
multiple configuration are available, and can be selected when needed.
Information can be shared between all profiles by being global.
Profiles contain separate versions of complete files.

*) The global files are stored in /etc/sysconfig/networking/<FILENAME>

*) The files for the default profile are stored in
   /etc/sysconfig/networking/default

*) Files for other profiles are stored in
   /etc/sysconfig/networking/<name-of-profile>/

FILES:

*1* resolv.conf

This file is copied to /etc/resolv.conf when the profile 
is activated (if necesarry... if the file is identical, why bother).
The format is the standard one, but we'll omit domain... search does
the same thing.

1) A list of up to six domains in which to resolve hostnames:
   search foo.com bar.org ...
2) Up to three lines of the form "nameserver 192.168.0.1" with the DNS
   servers the system will use for name resolution


*2* network 

This replaces the old /etc/sysconfig/network, and contains at least
the following information in the name=value ("shell") format:

HOSTNAME (FQDN), NETWORKING ("yes","no"), GATEWAY (no need for
GATEWAYDEV, if you already have routes and interfaces configured,
right?), NISDOMAINNAME (or should we just move this kindof information 
somewhere else, so LDAP etc, can be configured in the same file), 

All IPX is gone

*3* staticroute

Format not yet here, but it's NOT going to be the same as earlier,
which just listed the commands to the route command... ipv4 and 6
should be in the same file.

*4* ifcfg-<devicename>

This will vary slightly for different kinds of devices... they are in
name=value format. Here are the ones common for all devices:

NAME, DESCRIPTION, ENABLED, IDENTIFIER, TYPE

*4.1* Ethernet

MACADDRESS - this is the address to match to: You can specify that a
device has a certain mac address so you can map a network device to a
NIC without depending on the order of module insertions or other
kernel initialization issues.

BOOTPROTO - if set to DHCP, the system will get its configuration from
a DHCP server.
