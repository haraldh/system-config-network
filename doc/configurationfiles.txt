Work In Progress - please add the files you're working on here

************************************************************************
This is meant to be a short description of what files are used by the
network configuration the information they contain they contain.

PROFILES.

The network configuration system is profiled - this means that
multiple configuration are available, and can be selected when needed.
Information can be shared between all profiles by being global.
Profiles contain separate versions of complete files.

*) The global files are stored in /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/<FILENAME>

*) The files for the default profile are softlinked from
   /etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/default

*) Files for other profiles are softlinked from
   /etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/<name-of-profile>/

*) The startup files will be softlinked to
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<kerneldevicename>


FILES:

*1* resolv.conf

This file is copied to /etc/resolv.conf when the profile 
is activated (if necesarry... if the file is identical, why bother).
The format is the standard one, but we'll omit domain... search does
the same thing.

1) A list of up to six domains in which to resolve hostnames:
   search foo.com bar.org ...
2) Up to three lines of the form "nameserver 192.168.0.1" with the DNS
   servers the system will use for name resolution

*2* hosts

Again, this file will be copied to /etc/hosts from the activated profile, but
only if it is different.

*3* network 

This replaces the old /etc/sysconfig/network, and contains at least
the following information in the name=value ("shell") format:

HOSTNAME (FQDN), NETWORKING ("yes","no"), GATEWAY (no need for
GATEWAYDEV, if you already have routes and interfaces configured,
right?), NISDOMAINNAME (or should we just move this kindof information 
somewhere else, so LDAP etc, can be configured in the same file), 
Additionally it may contain CURRENT_PROFILE (and maybe DEFAULT_PROFILE).

All IPX is gone

*4* staticroute

Format not yet here, but it's NOT going to be the same as earlier,
which just listed the commands to the route command... ipv4 and 6
should be in the same file.

*5* ifcfg-<identifier>

For the devices in networking/devices/ we will drop the notion of using the
sick way of storing semantic information about the devices in the filename
but rather use the netconf device names here and do the 'conversion' to the
old style upon exit of netconf and/or via the profile selection tool.

We might even want to adapt the initscripts to do the right thing if time
permits.

This will vary slightly for different kinds of devices... they are in
name=value format. Here are the ones common for all devices:

NAME, DESCRIPTION, ENABLED, IDENTIFIER, TYPE

*5.1* Ethernet

MACADDRESS - this is the address to match to: You can specify that a
device has a certain mac address so you can map a network device to a
NIC without depending on the order of module insertions or other
kernel initialization issues.

BOOTPROTO - if set to DHCP, the system will get its configuration from
a DHCP server.

A list of adresses, which contains DEVICE, ADDRESS, PREFIX, SCOPE and BROADCAST -
since this is a list, add the number of the device in the name - e.g, DEVICE0, SCOPE2 
etc.

*6* ppp, provider and wvdial

For dialup configuration we have to additionally store the corresponding ppp,
wvdial and provider information. this will be done under the
networking/devices/devicename.d directory where we can keep any of these link
specific files/directories.
