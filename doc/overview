.oOo.  Netconf  .oOo.
=====================

Priorities
----------
There are 3 priorities:

 0: Mandatory. Without these, we're screwed.
 1: Optional but important. We should try to cover them as much as possible.
 2: Optional less important. Nice to have, but can wait till next release.

Project plan
------------

05/21/01:	Feature list soft freeze.
05/23/01:	Basic GUI design first draft ready.
05/28/01:	Feature list hard freeze.
		Detailed Spec soft freeze.
05/30/01:	Complete GUI finished.
		Ethernet device configurable.
		Initscripts working.
06/06/01:	1st design review.
		Detailed spec hard freeze.
		Basic device setup complete.
		Security setup finished.
06/13/01:	Dialup devices finished.
		Commandline tool finished.
		Traffic shaper finished.
		Accounting finished.
06/20/01:	2nd design review.
		Wireless device finished.
		CIPE device finished.
		Newt interface finished.
		Profile switcher finished.
06/27/01:	Internal QA done.
		Code cleanup.
		Final design review.
07/03/01:	First 'offical' beta.

Depending on problems or delays we can cut tasks from the last two weeks and
use them to fix/stabilize the code.

After begin of July we can solidify the codebase and do the usual qa/fix cycle.

Detailed Task specs
-------------------

Design (partially repeated from devhtml):
 - Keep it simple
 - Consolidate most if not all existing NW setup tools
 - Modular design (new device types, new configuration options)
 - Profiles feature
 - Firewalling and NAT support
 - Backwards compatibility resp. migration of existing config
 - Integrate all dialup services in one consistent database (Modem, ISDN)
 - IPv6 support
 - Use iproute for interface setup
 - Command line tool for automatic/scriptable setup (see kickstart)
 - Alchemist XML backend as well as native format read and write support

Profiles:
 - Need to separate between devices and profiles
 - Global Profile (e.g. lo device)
 - Profiles should be very simple to use and similar to the current setup
 - Use a rc.d, init.d kind of link system for profiles and devices

Devices:
 - Virtual device names to make physical devices multi configurable
 - Add/Edit a device once and use it in multiple profiles
 - Device type specific setup (Ethernet, Modem, ISDN, ADSL, CIPE, CTC etc.)

GUI:
 - Python/GTK using glade
 - Consistent look of tool in all windows (GUI design guidelines), see
   rhn_register or up2date clients.
 - Separation between GUI and device/profile setup code (backend has to be
   GUI independant for commandline tool!)
 - Commandline tool does not necessarily need to support all config options
