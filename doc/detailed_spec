.oOo.  Netconf  Detailed Specification .oOo.
============================================

1. Framework
------------

The framework, as described in devhtml/os/todo/new-netconf.html, separates the
new network configuration tool in a couple of logical modules:

 - Backend: Reading and writing native config files, new initscripts.
 - Library: List of hardware devices, python class struture for devices etc,
   tied together with the Alchemist for XML backend usage.
 - Profiles: In order to have multiple network setups.
 - GUI: Python/Glade/GTK and commandline frontend.


2. How does it work?
--------------------

2.1 Netconf devices and kernel/hardware devices
-----------------------------------------------

The current tools we have for network setup will now be integrated into one.
The basic principle is that we will configure devices. A device in netconf can
be tied to one of the following hardware devices:

 - Lan network card (Ethernet, TokenRing, Arcnet, etc).
 - Modem
 - ISDN-Card
 - Wireless Card
 - PLIP
 - CIPE
 - CTC

The Hardware related setup will be done separately from the pure device setup.
That way we can achive to a single hardware device in multiple netconf devices.

Each netconf device will then be tied to one of the configured hardware
devices. Each netconf device will have a unique name, beginning with a letter
followed by letters and numbers. No other characters are allowed for netconf
device names.

A netconf device can then be configured in respect to it's network setup,
namely:

 - netconf device name
 - device specific link information (e.g. dialup or wireless cards)
 - bootup activation
 - user enabled start/stop
 - TCP/IP address setup (bootp, dhcp, dialup, manual), manual with ip/netmask
 - Host information (manual or via provider/dialup)
 - Routing (default route or network routes)
 - Security (easy, advanced and expert setup)
 - Traffic control: ip/port, min-in, max-in, min-out, max-out configurable
 - Accounting

The device specific link information can be very simple as for Lan devices,
but e.g. for ISDN or Modems we will provide the selection of a provider,
telephone number and various other access information. There will be a general
dialup configuration for Modems and ISDN, using a merged provider database
of rp3 and isdn/adsl-config.

All configured devices will be stored in

 /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/$netconfdevname

and may contain a subdirectory called

 /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ifcgf-${netconfdevname}.d

for dialup or netconf device specific information (e.g. ppp or others)


2.2 Profile management and setup
--------------------------------

Profiles will be implemented using directories. A profile may contain any
number of netconf devices as well as one DNS information (and maybe more
'global' information later, to be defined).
The only restriction for the devies is that only one unique kernel device per
profile may be active (no two eth0 devices may be active at the same time).

Each profile will be created under

 /etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/$profilename

and will contain softlinks to the active devices in ../../devices/.

A special profile will exist called default which will contain all netconf
devices that are enabled in all profiles (e.g. lo). It's location is

 /etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/default/

Each profile directory will additionally contain a resolv.conf file with the
corresponding DNS setup.

After quitting netconf will create soft links from the active profiles (starting
with default and using the devices from the active profile) to

 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-${kerneldevicename}

This will allow us to use the old initscripts, thus maintaining compatibility
while still being able to use the new profile feature.


3. Middle layer
---------------

The middle layer of netconf will consist of a clearly defined XML data
structure and the generated Python classes from that. It will be used for the
general data manipulation from the GUI. The classes provide Python style
access to data as well as commit/rollback features for larger changes (see:
parsing a dialog or hitting the cancel button).

Another set of classes will handle the native file parsing and writing. That
way be basically use the Alchemist for data handling and manipulation and use
the native file formats as 'final' data representation instead of XML (yet?).

The names of the various native files and the contents we are able to configure
with netconf will be kept up to date in doc/configurationfiles.txt.


4. GUI
------

The GUI will be again Python/GTK based. It will start up with a list of
devices, possibly containing detected but unconfigured ones. Another tab will
allow hardware setup or manual addition of hardware. A third tab is for DNS
setup and a forth for the profile management/selection/setup.
The hardware setup will look different for each type of hardware while still
trying to look very much like we had in the previous tools.
Device setup will be completely new but all tabs will resemble strongly the
things presented in anaconda and other tools again.


5. Commandline
--------------

The commandline tool will allow scripted setup of devices. It's not decided
wether we will support hardware setup and/or complex dialup setup, probably not
(as time permits).


6. Textmode
-----------

The textmode utility will allow the basic setup of devices, no special stuff.
It is basically used as a bootstrap utility to get networking up and running.
