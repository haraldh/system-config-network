<H2>1. Overview</H2>
<HR>
Welcome to the RedHat NEtwork Administration Tool. The purpose of this tool is
to allow a GUI based configuration of your network interfaces, including
Ethernet, Modem, ISDN, Wireless and xDSL connections as well as virtual
interfaces like CIPE.

<H2>5. The Druid</H2>
<HR>
In order to easily and quickly set up your Internet access you can use the
Internet Druid. It offers the possibility to set up either a new Modem, ISDN or
xDSL Internet connection.
<P>

<H3>5.2 Modem druid Step-By-Step</H3>
<P>
<H4>5.2.1 Modem hardware configuration dialog</H4>
<IMG SRC=images/druid3.png ALT="First druid dialog">
<P>
If you have never configured your Modem before, either with rp3 or with
this new configuration tool you will get this dialog to select the modem which
you want to use for your Internet connection.
<P>
In case a modem has been configured previously this dialog will be skipped and
the already configured modem will be used.
<P>
The following things can be configured:<BR>
<table cellspacing=10>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Modem Device</strong></td><td>The actualy physical device to which the modem is attached. A list of probed modems will be available or /dev/modem if no valid modem could be detected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Baud Rate</strong></td><td>The actual speed with which the modem is connected to the computer. If you should have problems with the default speed try a lower setting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Flow Control</strong></td><td>The connection type between computer and modem. This depends on the cable used and the capabilities of the modem and the serial device. Modern hardware and cables almost always use Hardware flow control. If the default doesn't work either try None or Software flow control.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Modem Volume</strong></td><td>The volume of the modem loudspeaker during dialing and connecting to the remote modem. Ranges between Off, Low, Medium, High and Very High.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Use touch tone dialing</strong></td><td>For older telephone systems you might want to disable the use of touch tone dialing and use the old pulse dialing method.</td>
