<h2>1 Overview</h2>
 
<hr> Welcome to the Red Hat NEtwork Administration Tool. The purpose of this
tool is to allow a GUI based configuration of your network interfaces,
including Ethernet, Modem, ISDN, Wireless and xDSL connections as well as
virtual interfaces like CIPE. 
<p>
<h2>2 The Administration tool</h2>
<hr>
The administration tool itself, called redhat-config-network or neat allows you
to configure and administer most of your network interfaces.
<P>
The tool itself is separated into 4 different parts:
<ul>
  <li>Network device configuration
  <li>Hardware configuration
  <li>DNS configuration
  <li>Hosts configuration
</ul>
<h3>2.1 The first screen</h3>
<img src="images/neat1.png" alt="First notebook of main dialog">
<P>
The first screen when you start redhat-config-network should look similar to
this the first time you start it.
<P>
As already described the main dialog is spearated into 4 tabs or notebooks.
The first one you see is the network device configuration notebook. On this
you can add, edit, copy and delete your network devices.
<P>
A network device in neat is always linked to a real physical hardware device
(which has to be configured in the Hardware notebook) in some way.
<P>
Network devices can be active or inactive. Active means that the actual
configuration for that device will be stored and used by the system when you
either apply your changes or if you close the application and chose to save
your changes and restart your network afterwards.
<P>
The <i>Help</i> button will bring up this help which you are reading right now.
<P>
The <i>Apply</i> button will store all your devices and other changes you have
made and will make the active devices visible for the system.
The <i>Close</i> button closes the application. A dialog will ask you wether
you want to store the configuration or not or if you don't want to quit the
application after all.
<h2>5 The Druid</h2>
 
<hr> In order to easily and quickly set up your Internet access you can use
the Internet Druid. It offers the possibility to set up either a new Modem,
ISDN or xDSL Internet connection. 
<p> </p>
<h3>5.1 Internet Druid dialog</h3>
 <img src="images/druid1.png" alt="Internet druid dialog">
 
<p> On the first page you can select which kind of connection you have. Select
the one you have and press the <em>Next</em> button. That will bring you
to the selected device type next druid page. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>5.2 Modem druid Step-By-Step</h3>
 
<p> </p>
<h4>5.2.1 Modem hardware configuration dialog</h4>
 <img src="images/druid3.png" alt="Modem hardware configuration dialog">
 
<p> If you have never configured your Modem before, either with rp3 or with 
this new configuration tool you will get this dialog to select the modem
which you want to use for your Internet connection. </p>
<p> In case a modem has been configured previously this dialog will be skipped
and the already configured modem will be used. </p>
<p> The following things can be configured:<br>
 
<table cellspacing="10">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Modem Device</strong></td>
      <td>The actualy physical device to which the modem is attached. A list
of probed modems will be available or /dev/modem if no valid modem could
be detected.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Baud Rate</strong></td>
      <td>The actual speed with which the modem is connected to the computer.
If you should have problems with the default speed try a lower setting.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Flow Control</strong></td>
      <td>The connection type between computer and modem. This depends on
the cable used and the capabilities of the modem and the serial device. Modern
hardware and cables almost always use Hardware flow control. If the default
doesn't work either try None or Software flow control.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Modem Volume</strong></td>
      <td>The volume of the modem loudspeaker during dialing and connecting
to the remote modem. Ranges between Off, Low, Medium, High and Very High.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Use touch tone dialing</strong></td>
      <td>For older telephone systems you might want to disable the use of
touch tone dialing and use the old pulse dialing method.</td>
   </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
 Again with the <em>Next</em> button you get to the next dialog, which is
the ISP setup. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5.2.2 Initial ISP selection dialog</h4>
 <img src="images/druid5.png" alt="Initial ISP selection dialog">
 
<p> To actually connect to the Internet you need to specify which ISP (Internet 
Service Provider) you have. </p>
<p> You can either fill in the information by hand on the right hand side
of the dialog or you can select one from the ISP database provided in the
tree on the left hand side. </p>
<p> For manual configuration you can edit the following things:<br>
 
<table cellspacing="10">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Prefix</strong></td>
      <td>The prefix for your modem. Usually used to get a line.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Area Code</strong></td>
      <td>The country and area code for your ISP.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Phone Number</strong></td>
      <td>The actual phone number of your ISP.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Provider Name</strong></td>
      <td>The name by which you want to identify your ISP.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Login Name</strong></td>
      <td>The login or username with which you login to your ISP.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td valign="Top"><strong>Password</strong></td>
      <td>The password for your login to your ISP.</td>
   </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
 With the <em>Next</em> button you will get to the final dialog where all 
information is displayed. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5.2.3 Filled ISP selection dialog</h4>
 <img src="images/druid6.png" alt="Filled ISP selection dialog">
 
<p> If you choose to select one of the ISPs from the database your ISP selection
dialog will look similar to the one above. All ISP entries provide at least
the area code, the phone number and the provider name. For call-by-ball ISPs
the login name and password are usually filled out as well. Depending on
wether you use a call-by-call provider or not you only need to enter or change
the login name and password.</p>
<p>The <i>Next</i> button will bring you to the final druid dialog, just
like when you filled in all information manually.<br>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5.2.4 Finished Modem dialup dialog</h4>
 <img src="images/druid11.png" alt="Finished Modem dialup dialog">
<br>
<br>
The final druid dialog displays all the relevant information of the connection
you set up. This includes the used hardware device, the provider name, the
login name and the phone number of he ISP.<br>
<br>
Clicking on <i>Finish</i> will store your selection. With <i>Back</i> you
can go back and make any changes you seem fit. Finally <i>Cancel</i> just
quits the druid and leaves the current configuration untouched.<br>
